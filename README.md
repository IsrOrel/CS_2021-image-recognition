# CycleGAN Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project leverages the CycleGAN deep learning model for image-to-image translation tasks. The focus is on personalizing the model using a custom dataset of images that are not publicly available for privacy reasons.

The project is based on the CycleGAN implementation available at:
[CycleGAN and pix2pix GitHub Repository](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix.git).

### Key Features:
- Customized dataset with images for source and target domains.
- Training and testing the CycleGAN model using the provided repository.
- Visualization of the results from the model.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- Access to the CycleGAN GitHub repository

### Clone the Repository
Clone the repository and navigate to its directory:
```
!git clone https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix.git
cd pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix
```

### Install Required Packages
Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Preparation
The dataset used for this project consists of personal images. For privacy reasons, this dataset will not be uploaded. 

To use your own dataset, organize the images in the following structure:
- `trainA`: Source domain images.
- `trainB`: Target domain images.

## Training the Model
Run the following command to train the model:
```
!python train.py \
    --dataroot /path/to/your/dataset \
    --name my_custom_cyclegan \
    --model cycle_gan
```

## Testing the Model
To test the model:
```
!python test.py \
    --dataroot /path/to/your/dataset/testA \
    --name my_custom_cyclegan \
    --model test \
    --no_dropout
```

## Visualizing Results
Generated images are stored in the results directory specified during testing. Use a visualization tool like `IPython.display` to display them programmatically.

## Notes
- This project is built using the CycleGAN implementation from [this repository](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix.git).
- You can replace the dataset with your own images for personalized results.

## Future Improvements
- Automate dataset preprocessing.
- Add more visualization options for result comparison.
